# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this project, please report it to us as soon as possible through a private channel. **Do not open a public issue on GitHub.**

In order for the vulnerability reports to reach maintainers as soon as possible, the preferred way is to use the "Report a vulnerability" button under the "Security" tab of the associated GitHub project. This creates a private communication channel between the reporter and the maintainers.

If you are absolutely unable to or have strong reasons not to use GitHub's vulnerability reporting workflow, please send an email to [christopher.koning@gmail.com](mailto:christopher.koning@gmail.com) with the following information:

*   **Your name and affiliation (optional)**
*   **A detailed description of the vulnerability**, including:
    *   The type of vulnerability (e.g., XSS, SQL injection, buffer overflow)
    *   Affected versions or components
    *   Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
    *   Potential impact of the vulnerability
*   **Any proof-of-concept or exploit code (optional but helpful)**
*   **Your preferred method of contact for follow-up**

## Our Disclosure Policy

Upon receiving a vulnerability report, our security team will:

1.  **Acknowledge receipt** of your report within [e.g., 2 business days].
2.  **Investigate and confirm** the vulnerability.
3.  **Develop a fix** for the vulnerability in a timely manner.
4.  **Coordinate disclosure** with the reporter, if desired, to ensure responsible disclosure.
5.  **Release a patched version** and announce the fix via [e.g., project release notes, security advisory].

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are generally provided for the latest stable release and the immediately preceding major version. Older versions may not receive security updates.

## Security Best Practices

We encourage users to follow security best practices, including:

*   Keeping your dependencies updated to the latest secure versions.
*   Following secure coding practices when contributing to the project.
*   Exercising caution when handling sensitive data.
